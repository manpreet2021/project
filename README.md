# project
This is simple sample project which contains simple apis through which patients can register and can book their appointment.
The Project contains simple apis for creation of patient account, updation of account,book an appointment and can delete his/her account.
I have made use of JWT Token in the project for patient login, patient can create his/her account eithout authorization but he/she must 
have authorization to  access other apis(like updatation and deletion ,booking appointment). 
Spring Security is used to generate Jwt authorization token,Mysql Connector is used to make connection with database gradle is used as a dependency
manager.
